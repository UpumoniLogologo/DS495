# DS495

Understanding the internal structure of rocks is crucial for applications in geology, petroleum engineering, and environmental science. This study leverages high-resolution images from the Digital Rocks Portal to generate and evaluate 3D meshes of rock samples, including Sand Pack, Mt. Gambier limestone, a glass Bead Pack, and Castlegate sandstone. Advanced mesh quality metrics, such as aspect ratio, Jacobian, and element size distribution, were used to assess the suitability of these meshes for reliable simulations.

Results indicate that Gambier and Bead Pack demonstrate higher mesh quality and tighter distributions, making them ideal for accurate and efficient simulations. In contrast, Sand Pack and Castlegate show greater variability and higher frequencies of small elements, suggesting challenges with element distortion, non-uniformity, and computational complexity. The findings provide insights into improving mesh generation processes and guiding future enhancements to optimize simulations of rock behavior. This research contributes to advancements in geoscience modeling, supported by funding and resources from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), and the DS495 class at Chaminade University of Honolulu.
